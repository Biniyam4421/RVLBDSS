I obtained my PhD in civil, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, with a specialization in [Fluid Dynamics and Environmental Engineering](http://dottorato.dicca.unige.it/eng/fluamb/) from the University of Genoa, Italy.   

My previous experiences working in the academy, consulting, and construction sectors inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. The further one immerses in the field of hydraulic and hydrologic engineering it becomes clear that the ability of the professional to engage in cross-cutting work depends on the level of [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) (CFD) knowledge he/she has. The main reason is that fluid flow is governed by partial differential equations representing conservation laws of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum), and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy). Understanding the principles behind and gaining the ability to solve such problems efficiently in a computer architecture, such as with [High-Performance Computing](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing) (HPC), gives the professional an imaginable upper hand over a given problem. 

My work and research
======

I have a strong background in the fundamentals of computational fluid dynamics. I also work well with different programming languages and parallel computing.

My Ph.D. project uses numerical modeling to examine the implications of vortex dynamics on the evolution of wave ripples in an oscillatory flow. It was performed to detect features of the flow field which influence the equilibrium ripple shape, and sediment transport on the onshore [(B. Sishah and  G. Vittori, 2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021JC017439). The primary tool in use is [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/).

In line with the Ph.D. project, I was involved in different researches. The first collaboration proposed a parametric boundary condition that can incorporate the effect of large-scale roughness (i.e., vortex ripples) in a wall-bounded turbulent oscillatory flow without the need to use the modified log-low of turbulence for roughness. In the second collaboration, we examined how stresses and deformation are distributed in a gravity dam in the course of an earthquake. This study also compared predicted results with different approaches to understand the implication choice of method has on engineering decision making. Thirdly, I was involved in a collabration that examined sedimentation rate and sediment distribution changes in an artificial reservoir in response to a land cover change in an upland catchment. These collaborations have resulted in conference presentations and publications. 


My background and history
======

My M.Sc was from the [Water resources engineering](https://iupware.be/). The program was co-hosted by the [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) and the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en/home). I took my B.Sc. in Water resources and environmental engineering from [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/). 

I have held multiple teaching positions in [Jimma University](https://www.ju.edu.et/), [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University](http://www.aastu.edu.et/), and [Ethiopian Technical University](https://www.ftveti.edu.et/). I have also worked in the consultancy and construction sectors. In these positions, I have worked at the levels of freelance consultant, Sanitary engineer, and Project manager. 


My intellectual communities
------
I aspire to tackle the hardest problems in the field of atmospheric science, hydraulic and hydrological engineering.
