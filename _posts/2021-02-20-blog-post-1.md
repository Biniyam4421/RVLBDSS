Why has Machine learning not yet revolutionized Computational Fluid Dynamics?
--------
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (ML) has yet to play an essential role in [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) (CFD). This translates to the fact that physical laws govern fluid flows and often, chaos is at the heart of most naturally occurring flows. Henceforth, BlackBox approach followed by most ML techniques will have little chance of describing the behavior of most fluids, but Physics-informed ML approchs might solve the puzzle.

First, let's dive into the chaos at the heart of fluid dynamics and discuss the modeling approaches. Afterwards, we shall refer to a phenomenon in fluid dynamics where ML ( BlackBox/Physics-informed) approachs can play a pivotal role. 

Chaos is at the heart of fluid dynamics
=====

Most engineering applications deal with fluids that are in [turbulent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence) regimes. Deep down, the phenomenon of turbulence shows a peculiar signature—the energy stored in large swirling eddies cascades to finer and finer eddies. [Vortex stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_stretching), which is visualized in three-dimensional numerical simulations, is intrinsic to this process. When the swirling eddies reach the [Kolmogorov scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_microscales), they die out because of fluid viscosity, and energy dissipation takes place. This process repeats itself in the presence of a turbulence source.

[Turbulence at the fundmental level](https://www.nortekgroup.com/knowledge-center/wiki/new-to-turbulent-flow-1)

High-fidelity [Direct Numerical Simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_numerical_simulation) (DNS) apply this principle to understand turbulence better. Numerical models are set up such that sizes of mesh elements and the computational time are within the length and time scale of the Kolmogorov scales, respectively. This way, every bit of fluctuation the fluid undergoes is captured. Such simulations have unraveled a lot about turbulence.

[DNS Resolved turbulence](https://www.google.com/search?q=DNS+turbulent+high+quality+images&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjIvM349432AhVS1uAKHRbECvUQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=DNS+turbulent+high+quality+images&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoHCCMQ7wMQJ1DfBliDH2CSImgAcAB4AIABcYgB1QWSAQQxMC4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=rAUSYsi2HtKsgweWiKuoDw&bih=951&biw=2048#imgrc=x0ME3JKGwl-SRM)

Despite its high-quality output, the DNS-based approach is unrealistic for most industrial applications due to the high computational overhead. As a result, most engineering-based CFD simulations are carried out with reduced order turbulence models, such as [Large Eddy Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) (LES), [Detached Eddy Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detached_eddy_simulation) (DES), and the so-called [Eddy viscosity-based](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/eddy-viscosity) [Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds-averaged_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) turbulence models (RANS) . 

LES is by far the industries' most favorite nowadays. It applies spatial filtering such that turbulence scales over mesh elements are resolved, and those turbulent scales below mesh element sizes are modeled with a subgrid-scale viscosity. Depending on the mesh resolution adopted, models categorized under the LES family can resolve much of the turbulence energy in a given flow.

On the other hand, RANS-based turbulence models model turbulence rather than resolve it. These methods use calibrated transport-based parametric equations to represent the generation and dissipation of turbulence energy—the focus being to compute the average flow fields correctly. However, such models have drawbacks when applied to flows with adverse pressure gradient and separation. In some instances, these models prdit increased Reynolds stresses too. 

DES reconciles the physics of LES and RANS at the wall for wall-bounded flows. It dramatically reduces the computational overhead endured by LES-based models close to a wall by adapting RANS based models in the vicinity of the wall.

Another phenomenon that complicates flow prediction is the presence of a roughness element with a length scale much smaller than the bulk flow length scale but which can modify bulk flow quantities such as wall shear stress, drag and lift forces. Having such roughness elements in the flow field raises a problem when deciding how to incorporate them in a given model - Express them physically in the mesh or use parametric equations to describe their influence on the bulk flow field. 

When the roughness scale is much larger (still smaller than the bulk flow length scale), it can trigger vorticity and enhance form drag. This further complicates modeling of such flows.

[Sishah, B. and Vittori, G. (2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021JC017439)

In DNS or LES, these roughness scales need to be incorporated into the mesh. In contrast, in DES or RANS-based approaches, there is the option to use parametric equations that can describe the influence of the roughness element on the flow field without the need to incorporate it physically in the mesh. This enormously reduces computational costs but, on the other hand, makes the numerical models prone to false predictions, and much benchmarking is needed to get better results. 

The modified-[log law of turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_wall#:~:text=In%20fluid%20dynamics%2C%20the%20law,boundary%20of%20the%20fluid%20region.) for roughness (the [Nikuradse law](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nikuradse)) has been widely adopted in this regard. But still, there is a huge uncertainty in how the [equivalent Sand-Grain roughness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/equivalent-sand-grain-roughness) is expressed when the roughness size is large and can instigate form drag.

A way forward

In the presence of aboundent data, Machine learning could play a pivotal role in selecting the right parametrization for the equivalent sand-grain roughness. In fact, this could be a stepping stone for ML to play its part in CFD.
