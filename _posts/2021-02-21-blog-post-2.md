Why we need better coastal models?
--------
According to a recent study reported in [nature communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04692-w), by 2050, 340 million people will live on land below the expected annual flood levels, and the figure doubles by 2100. The key factors are urbanization and [Global warning](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/)-induced changes to  sea levels, [storm surges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge), [wind waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave#:~:text=In%20fluid%20dynamics%2C%20a%20wind,is%20known%20as%20the%20fetch.), and hydrologic inputs. Henceforth, to overcome the hazards that will be posed by coastal floods, coastal cities need to be designed [flood-resilient](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2019.0212).

Choosing the appropriate adaptation strategy to coastal flooding based on forcasts given by coastal models is not as straightforward as it sounds. This inherently goes to the high degree of uncertainty that is embedded in coastal flood level forecasting. This blog discusses the role coastal models play in this regard and how this uncertainty might be reduced.


The problem - The solution
======

To date, coastal models are not sufficiently process-based. Some components of the model that significantly influence coastal flood predictions implicitly use parametric equations to represent critical processes. These include seabed resistance, bed level changes, etc. Whenever a parametric equation is involved, the predictive capability of a model depends on the quality of the field data used during the parametric estimation. Furthermore, prevalent parameter estimation techniques are stationary. This fundamentally obscures the dynamism of the continuously evolving coastal environment that these models represent.

The second reason that increases uncertainty in coastal flood modeling is the scale at which problems are solved. Often, problems are solved at scales much larger than those sufficient to capture processes that inherently influence a coastal flooding event. This is usually done to reduce computational costs. This problem will have less impact soon as computational expenses are going down.

Third, coastal models often fail to incorporate the co-occurrence of multiple flood pathways. This neglected interaction between inland hydrology and hydraulics with the coastal environment may lead to prediction errors on flood levels and their timing. Henceforth, better representation of Coastal‚ÄêRiverine relationships in coastal models is needed.

Equality important is [stochasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic) in model ouputs. Coastal models should clearly convey the uncertanities inbeded in thier prediction and their likly sources. wheather they are generated bbecause of the mathematical model adopted or the parametric estimation procedurer or the observational datasets that were used in the parametric estimation and model validation procedures. This becomes much more important as we head to a time when climate change is likely to affect the predictability of weather and climate conditions adversely.

A way forward
======
Coastal models must gradually adopt a sufficiently process-based modeling approach that considers Multiple Flood Pathways and a technique for detecting the sources and magnitude of the model uncertainty implicit in the model predictions. This is crucial in our quest to create flood-resilient coastal cities of the future.
