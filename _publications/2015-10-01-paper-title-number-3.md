excerpt: 'The study examinined the role land cover dynamics plays on reservoir sedimentation rate by coupling a distributed variable source area hydrological (SWAT-VSA) and a process-based hydrodynamic (Delft3D) model. The study area was Gilgel Gibe III hydropower development dam reservoir in southern Ethiopia. '
