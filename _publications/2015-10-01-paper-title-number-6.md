title: "Implications of the vortex dynamics on the evolution of vortex ripples in an oscillatory flow"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-6
excerpt: 'The oscillatory turbulent flow over fixed two-dimensional ripples is numerically solved by using appropriate closure. The aim of the contribution is that of detecting features of the flow field which infulences the ripple shape and the sediment transport.'
