excerpt: 'In the present investigation we use a numerical model to compute the steady velocity component which is generated by the presence of ripples at the sea bottom. It will be shown that the steady cross‐shore velocity component can be directed either onshore or offshore, depending on the values of the parameters. Moreover, this steady velocity component turns out to be an order of magnitude stronger than that generated over a plane bottom.'
