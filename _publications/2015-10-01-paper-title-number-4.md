permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This  paper  presents  efforts  to  simulate  tides  in  the  Belgian  Continental  Shelf  (BCS)  using  the numerical model [TELEMAC-2D](http://www.opentelemac.org/index.php/presentation?id=17). Simulations are performed during the calm period (in terms of wind) of July 2013, in order to reduce the impact of meteorological conditions.'
