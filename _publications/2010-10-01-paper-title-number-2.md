title: "Modeling the structural response of a dam to earthquake-induced dynamic stresses"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The structural response of a dam to an earthquake with a dominant horizontal ground acceleration was modeled using three techniques: static structural analysis, one- and two-way coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) modeling approaches. The aim was to investigate how the choice of method affects the  peak  total  deformation,  the  principal  stresses,  and  the  maximum  shear  stresses  within  the  dam body.'
